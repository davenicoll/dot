# Personal dotfiles and scripts

These dotfiles are intended to be used when first setting up Ubuntu/macOS. After a fresh install, I like to clone this repo into my home folder, and symlink the dotfiles to make it easier to push any changes back to this repo. Everything works as expected in Ubuntu 21.04, macOS support coming soon...

## Installation

**Warning:** Pilfer at your own peril :) If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. 

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/davenicoll/dotfiles.git "$HOME/.dotfiles"
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```
