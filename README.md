# Personal dotfiles and scripts

Pilfer at your own peril :)

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. 

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/davenicoll/dot.git
cd dot
./setup.sh
```
